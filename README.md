## Another CSS Framework?

There are many amazing css frameworks out there and everything from really minimalist to an all inclusive large framework.

I liked the grids from [Toast](https://github.com/daneden/Toast), the size of [min](https://github.com/owenversteeg/min), the build tool from [pure](http://purecss.io/), and other bits from [Kube](https://github.com/imperavi/kube) and [Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton).

This is a tight collection of small independent css modules featuring style, responsive-ness, and low-specificity.

There is a web build tool available allowing you to customize your build from the variables to which components you'll actually be using.
